The problem of the huge problem is the small problem. And we know exactly how to solve
this small problem with our useless contract and tons of trendy words below:

As you probably know *blockchain powered identification* for the blockchain is the problem for everyone. At the same time **token-based pseudo-identification** is exactly better option. That's why ERC-721 standard is can help us a lot. Usually we expect that address-based identification for blockchain ID is not the best option. That's why token-based identification for blockchain ID will many lots of pain-points.

Everyone knows that solidity-powered wallet for ID is not the best solution for humanity. That's why blockchain-based token for ID will save tons of the struggle in this case. Honestly saying Ethereum-based token for identification is exactly the best option here.

I'm smart, and you have to give us the ~~ETC~~ ETH.
